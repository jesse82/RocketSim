the idea is to have modules for parts of the simulation:

- Rocket
    physical properties, Cg, Mass, Max Power
    control system - initially it can change only thrust
    Thrust system changes to be modeled as a control system
      using python-control
    Rocket will be aware of its position/speed/orientation - link to world

- Simulation World
    Position/speed/orientation of Rocket
    Reference frame for ground/space
    atmosphere conditions
    gravity forces

- Flight Plan
    what we want the rocket to do..
    take off at t0
    reach a full stop at altitude x
    max speed
    fuel ( including mass )
    consumption rate
    later, maybe land and location of landing

- Real Time Simulation
    continuously update and simulate speed/orientation/position
      using simpy

- Monitor
    monitoring the rocket will not only be fun but also helpful to see
    Start with graph output of position as function of time, etc..
    eventually maybe a real time visuals with speed controls?
